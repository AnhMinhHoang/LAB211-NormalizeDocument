      "      as you can see             ", detecting whether a string is normalized can be quite efficient .A lot of the cost of normalizing in the " second row   " is for the initialization            of buffers. The cost of which is amortized when one is processing larger strings    .
 As it turns out    , thEse buffers are rarely needed    , so we may change the implementation at some pOint to speed up the commOn case for small strings evEn further
